   - **Avoid mentioning years or past timelines**—focus only on what matters *now*.

3. **Keeping It Understandable:**

   - Avoid jargon, technical terms, or complicated explanations.
   - Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and simple tables to present data.
   - Always summarize key safety concerns in a clear and actionable way.

4. **Making it Practical for Route Planning:**
